Introduction to llmHDL
Welcome to the world of `llmHDL`, a modern hardware description language tailored for precision and ease of use. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of the language, key features, and best practices to ensure you can effectively describe digital circuits without the usual pitfalls.

1. Understanding Basic Data Types
In llmHDL, the fundamental building block is the bit. Bit types define the width:

`u1` represents a single bit.
`u3` represents 3 bits.
... and so forth.

Remember:
`u8` is used as a character in llmHDL. Example: `let null:u8 = '\0';`
Bit types can have attributes. For instance, `u3::MAX` is the maximum value a `u3` can hold, which is `0b111`.

2. Compound Data Types

Tuples and Arrays are your friends:
Tuples are ordered sets. Example: `(u3:0b100, u4:0b1101)`.
Arrays use the bracket notation: `let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3]`;
Tip: Use tuples when you have heterogeneous data, and arrays when your data is uniform.

3. Functions in llmHDL

Here's the basic anatomy of a function:
```
fn function_name(input1: type1, input2: type2) -> return_type {
    // Function body
}
```
Important notes:
The return type of a function should always match the actual returned value's type.
Functions support implicit return; the last statement is considered the return value if not explicitly stated.

4. Operations and Pitfalls

Operations are intuitive but require care:
Use standard bitwise operations (`^`, `&`, `|`).
When mixing bit widths, make sure to explicitly handle type promotions.

Explicit Type Extension:
Instead of directly operating on different bit widths, always ensure the operands have the same bit width.
Use concatenation `++` to extend bits. Example: To extend `u1` to `u2`: `let extended_bit: u2 = u1:0 ++ your_bit;`

Avoid Using Reserved Keywords:
In llmHDL, certain terms are reserved. One such term we came across is `carry`.
Using reserved keywords as variable or function names will lead to errors.

5. Structs, Enums, and Testing

Structs and Enums allow you to bundle related data:
Structs are custom data types with fields.
Enums allow you to define a type that has a fixed set of constants.
Note: Always remember to test! Use `assert_eq` for testing. It helps validate your logic.

6. Common Mistakes & Tips

Type mismatches:
Always ensure the annotated type matches the inferred type. For example, ensure the function's return type matches the returned value's type.

Casting:
In llmHDL, casting is a bit restrictive. Always ensure you're using casting correctly, especially when working with constants.

Reserved Keywords:
Watch out for reserved keywords! Don't use them as variable or function names to avoid confusion.

Conclusion
llmHDL offers a blend of modern programming conventions with the precision required for hardware description. By being mindful of the language's nuances and understanding its constructs, you can create efficient and error-free digital circuit descriptions.

If you're interested in diving deeper into the language, here are some topics you might consider exploring further:

1. Modules in llmHDL: Modules are reusable code segments that can represent larger building blocks in digital circuit design. How are they declared and used?
2. llmHDL Simulation: Simulation is a crucial aspect of digital circuit design, allowing designers to predict how the circuit will behave before implementing it physically. How does llmHDL handle simulation? Are there built-in tools or compatibility with external simulators?
3. Interfacing with other HDLs: In the world of digital design, it's often necessary to interface with other hardware description languages like VHDL or Verilog. How seamless is this integration with llmHDL?
4. Synthesis with llmHDL: Once a design is complete, it needs to be translated into a format that can be implemented on physical hardware, like an FPGA or ASIC. How does llmHDL support this process?
5. Parameterization in llmHDL: One of the advantages of modern HDLs is the ability to write generic and parameterizable code. How does llmHDL handle parameterization, and what are the best practices around it?
6. State Machine Design: Digital circuits often require state machines. Does llmHDL offer any particular constructs or best practices for designing and implementing state machines?

By exploring these topics, users can get a holistic understanding of `llmHDL` and maximize the advantages it offers in the realm of digital design.

## You
I have a new HDL programming language called llmHDL that resembles a modern language like
rust but it has the following key differences:

* Support multiple bit sizes `fn call(a:bits[3])` is the same as `fn call(a:u3)`

* Bit types can have attributes like `u3::MAX == 0b111`

* u8 is a character `let null:u8 = '\0';`

* The tuple type is an ordered set `let pair = (u3:0b100, u4:0b1101);`

* The array type uses bracket notation. E.g: `let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3];`

* assert_eq does not need the ! for macro

* type casting allows to convert across bitwidths. E.g: `assert((u4:0b1100) as u2 == u2:0)`

* Structs and tuples have by default a `PartialEq` implementation.

*llmHDL only supports “implicit return”. This means that the final expression in a function will automatically be used as the return value if no explicit return statement is given.

*llmHDL only supports assert_eq for testing

*In llmHDL the Return type of function body has to match the annotated return type.

*`carry` is a keyword, form naming, use specific naming to avoid confusion with keywords. It's important to choose variable names that are descriptive and meaningful, avoiding those that coincide with reserved keywords


Some sample code:

```
#[test]
fn test_tuple_access() {
  let t = (u32:2, u8:3);
  assert_eq(u8:3, t.1)
}
```

```
#[test]
fn test_black_hole() {
  let t = (u32:2, u8:3, true);
  let (_, _, v) = t;
  assert_eq(v, true)
}
```

```
struct Point {
  x: u32,
  y: u32,
}

#[test]
fn test_struct_equality() {
  let p0 = Point { x: u32:42, y: u32:64 };
  let p1 = Point { y: u32:64, x: u32:42 };
  assert_eq(p0, p1)
}
```

```
_Ok123_321        // valid identifier
_                 // valid identifier

2ab               // not valid identifier
&ade              // not valid identifier
```

```
fn ret3() -> u32 {
   u32:3   // This function always returns 3.
}

fn add1(x: u32) -> u32 {
   x + u32:1  // Returns x + 1, but you knew that!
}
```

```
// a simple parameter x of type u32
   x: u32

// t is a tuple with 2 elements.
//   the 1st element is of type u32
//   the 2nd element is a tuple with 3 elements
//       the 1st element is of type u8
//       the 2nd element is another tuple with 1 element of type u16
//       the 3rd element is of type u8
   t: (u32, (u8, (u16,), u8))
```

```
//Parametric Functions
fn double(n: u32) -> u32 {
  n * u32:2
}

fn self_append<A: u32, B: u32 = {double(A)}>(x: bits[A]) -> bits[B] {
  x++x
}

fn main() -> bits[10] {
  self_append(u5:1)
}
```

```
enum Opcode : u3 {
  FIRE_THE_MISSILES = 0,
  BE_TIRED = 1,
  TAKE_A_NAP = 2,
}

fn get_my_favorite_opcode() -> Opcode {
  Opcode::FIRE_THE_MISSILES
}
```

```
// The unit type, carries no information.
let unit = ();

// A tuple containing two bits-typed elements.
let pair = (u3:0b100, u4:0b1101);
```

```#[test]
fn test_tuple_access() {
  let t = (u32:2, u8:3);
  assert_eq(u8:3, t.1)
}
```

## ChatGPT
Thank you for introducing llmHDL. It does seem to incorporate aspects of modern languages, such as Rust, into a HDL paradigm, offering both intuitiveness and the specificity needed for hardware designs.

Let's try to break down some of the concepts and code samples you shared:

1. Bit Sizes and Types

The capability to define multiple bit sizes directly as function parameters (`fn call(a:u3)`) and attributes like `u3::MAX == 0b111` allows for greater clarity in the code.

2. Data Structures

- Characters being represented by u8, e.g., let null:u8 = '\0';, offers a direct mapping between byte-sized data and characters.
- Tuples in llmHDL are ordered sets, which seems quite handy. Given the example let pair = (u3:0b100, u4:0b1101);, this means you can group different bit-widths together in an ordered manner.
- Arrays, on the other hand, offer homogeneity in the type of data stored, with the added benefit of being able to define the size, e.g., let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3];.

3. Functions

- Implicit returns allow for concise function definitions, such as in the ret3() function which automatically returns 3.
- Annotated return types must match the type returned by the function, which is a useful guardrail to prevent type mismatches.
- Parametric functions, like self_append, allow for greater flexibility in the designs.

4. Identifiers

Your language seems to have a convention where identifiers start with underscores or alphabets and don't begin with numbers or symbols.

5. Testing

The `assert_eq` function offers a straightforward way to test and ensure correctness of the logic, given it does not require the `!` for macro use.

6. Advanced Types

- Structs: These are custom data types with fields. In the provided Point struct, you have x and y fields that are both u32 type.
- Enums: These allow for the definition of a set of named constants. For instance, Opcode is an enum with three values.

7. Special Mention

- carry being a reserved keyword is notable. This is especially pertinent in digital logic design where the concept of carry is essential. Making it a reserved keyword implies it might have a special meaning or usage in llmHDL.

In conclusion, llmHDL seems to offer a nice blend of precision, as required by HDLs, and the syntactic sugar of modern programming languages. Such an approach could potentially lead to shorter learning curves for those already familiar with modern programming paradigms, while still providing the functionality expected from a HDL.

## You
now, here is a `tiny_adder` function in llmHDL which gets 2 one-bit inputs and returns the add result, widened to reflect the carry bit. and also a test for it: ```

// Returns the add result, widened to reflect the carry bit.
fn tiny_adder(x: u1, y: u1) -> u2 {
  let lhs = x as u2;
  let rhs = y as u2;
  lhs + rhs
}

#[test]
fn test_exhaustive() {
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:0, u1:0), u2:0b00);
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:0, u1:1), u2:0b01);
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:1, u1:1), u2:0b10);
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:1, u1:0), u2:0b01);
}```

## ChatGPT
The `tiny_adder` function you've shared is an example of a simple adder that handles 1-bit inputs and provides a 2-bit output. The design captures both the sum and the carry of the addition.

Let's break down the function and its test:

tiny_adder function:

1. Function Signature:fn tiny_adder(x: u1, y: u1) -> u2: This states that the function named tiny_adder takes in two 1-bit unsigned integers as arguments (x and y) and returns a 2-bit unsigned integer.
2. fn tiny_adder(x: u1, y: u1) -> u2: This states that the function named tiny_adder takes in two 1-bit unsigned integers as arguments (x and y) and returns a 2-bit unsigned integer.
3. Conversion to 2-bits:let lhs = x as u2; and let rhs = y as u2;: Both 1-bit inputs are type-casted to 2-bits to facilitate addition without truncation or overflow.
4. let lhs = x as u2; and let rhs = y as u2;: Both 1-bit inputs are type-casted to 2-bits to facilitate addition without truncation or overflow.
5. Addition and Return:lhs + rhs: The two 2-bit numbers are added. Given the max value of a u1 type is 1 (or 0b1), the max value of their sum is 2 (or 0b10), which fits perfectly in a u2 type.
6. lhs + rhs: The two 2-bit numbers are added. Given the max value of a u1 type is 1 (or 0b1), the max value of their sum is 2 (or 0b10), which fits perfectly in a u2 type.

test_exhaustive function:

This function tests the `tiny_adder` function exhaustively for all possible input combinations of 1-bit numbers:

1. 0 + 0: assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:0, u1:0), u2:0b00);Expected output is 0 in 2-bit form, which is 0b00.
2. Expected output is 0 in 2-bit form, which is 0b00.
3. 0 + 1: assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:0, u1:1), u2:0b01);Expected output is 1, represented as 0b01 in 2-bit form.
4. Expected output is 1, represented as 0b01 in 2-bit form.
5. 1 + 1: assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:1, u1:1), u2:0b10);This is the key test. Here, the sum is 2, and there's a carry. Thus, the 2-bit output is 0b10.
6. This is the key test. Here, the sum is 2, and there's a carry. Thus, the 2-bit output is 0b10.
7. 1 + 0: assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:1, u1:0), u2:0b01);This is the same as the 2nd test, with operands reversed. The output is, as expected, 1 in 2-bit form, or 0b01.
8. This is the same as the 2nd test, with operands reversed. The output is, as expected, 1 in 2-bit form, or 0b01.

The tests verify the accuracy of the `tiny_adder` function, confirming its correct behavior for all 1-bit input combinations.

Overall, this is a clear and neat representation of a 1-bit adder in `llmHDL`. Given its simplicity, it also serves as a great introduction to the syntax and design methodology in `llmHDL`.

## You
Below I have several DSLX function headers, each of these functions represent a RISC-V instruction of the same name. Could you please write a DSLX program which enumerates each of the instructions and has a large switch/case statement that has a case for each instruction, where its corresponding function is called. The output of this program should be the called functions return value.
```
fn ror(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn rol(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn rori(rs1: u32, shamt: u32) -> u32 {
fn andn(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn orn(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn xnor(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn pack(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn packh(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn brev8(rs: u32) -> u32 {
fn rev8(rs: u32) -> u32 {
fn zip(rs1: u32) -> u32 {
fn unzip(rs1: u32) -> u32 {
fn sha512sum0r(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn sha256sum0(rs1: u32) -> u32 {
fn sha512sig0l(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn sha256sig0(rs1: u32) -> u32 {
fn sha256sum1(rs1: u32) -> u32 {
fn sha512sig1h(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn sha512sig0h(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn sha512sig1l(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn SHA512SUM1R(rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
fn sha256sig1(rs1: u32) -> u32 {
```

## ChatGPT
Alright, let's first enumerate these instructions. We will create an enum `Instruction` for this purpose. Once the instructions are enumerated, we'll write a function `execute` that takes an instruction and its operands and uses a switch/case construct to execute the appropriate instruction.

Here's the DSLX code implementing the given request:

```dslx
// Enumerating the instructions
enum Instruction : u32 {
  ROR,
  ROL,
  RORI,
  ANDN,
  ORN,
  XNOR,
  PACK,
  PACKH,
  BREV8,
  REV8,
  ZIP,
  UNZIP,
  SHA512SUM0R,
  SHA256SUM0,
  SHA512SIG0L,
  SHA256SIG0,
  SHA256SUM1,
  SHA512SIG1H,
  SHA512SIG0H,
  SHA512SIG1L,
  SHA512SUM1R,
  SHA256SIG1
}

// Your provided instruction functions go here...

// Function to execute a given instruction
fn execute(instruction: Instruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
  match instruction {
    Instruction::ROR => ror(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::ROL => rol(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::RORI => rori(rs1, rs2),  // Note: this assumes rs2 is shamt. Adjust if not.
    Instruction::ANDN => andn(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::ORN => orn(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::XNOR => xnor(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::PACK => pack(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::PACKH => packh(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::BREV8 => brev8(rs1),
    Instruction::REV8 => rev8(rs1),
    Instruction::ZIP => zip(rs1),
    Instruction::UNZIP => unzip(rs1),
    Instruction::SHA512SUM0R => sha512sum0r(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA256SUM0 => sha256sum0(rs1),
    Instruction::SHA512SIG0L => sha512sig0l(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA256SIG0 => sha256sig0(rs1),
    Instruction::SHA256SUM1 => sha256sum1(rs1),
    Instruction::SHA512SIG1H => sha512sig1h(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA512SIG0H => sha512sig0h(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA512SIG1L => sha512sig1l(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA512SUM1R => SHA512SUM1R(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA256SIG1 => sha256sig1(rs1)
  }
}

```

In this code:

1. We first create an enum to represent each instruction.
2. We then write the execute function which will take the instruction enum value and the operands (rs1 and rs2), and then use a switch/case (implemented via match in DSLX) to call the appropriate function.

Please note:

- The operands are assumed to be rs1 and rs2 for all functions for simplicity. In cases where the function only requires one operand (like brev8 or zip), only rs1 will be used. For instructions with special arguments like shamt in rori, I've assumed that rs2 is shamt. Adjust as needed.
- You'll need to integrate the body of each function (not provided in your snippet) in the above code to make it complete.

## You
That was close, but the enum statement had a syntax error as such:
```
0001: // Enumerating the instructions
0002: enum Instruction : u32 {
0003:   ROR,
~~~~~~~~~~~^ ParseError: Expected '=', got ','
```
I believe that each enumeration must have an explicit value assigned to it, you may simple assign them the range of values starting from 0
Could you rewrite the program given this new information?

## ChatGPT
Certainly! I apologize for the oversight. Here's the revised code with the corrected enumeration:

```dslx
// Enumerating the instructions with explicit values
enum Instruction : u32 {
  ROR = 0,
  ROL = 1,
  RORI = 2,
  ANDN = 3,
  ORN = 4,
  XNOR = 5,
  PACK = 6,
  PACKH = 7,
  BREV8 = 8,
  REV8 = 9,
  ZIP = 10,
  UNZIP = 11,
  SHA512SUM0R = 12,
  SHA256SUM0 = 13,
  SHA512SIG0L = 14,
  SHA256SIG0 = 15,
  SHA256SUM1 = 16,
  SHA512SIG1H = 17,
  SHA512SIG0H = 18,
  SHA512SIG1L = 19,
  SHA512SUM1R = 20,
  SHA256SIG1 = 21
}

// Your provided instruction functions go here...

// Function to execute a given instruction
fn execute(instruction: Instruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
  match instruction {
    Instruction::ROR => ror(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::ROL => rol(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::RORI => rori(rs1, rs2),  // Note: this assumes rs2 is shamt. Adjust if not.
    Instruction::ANDN => andn(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::ORN => orn(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::XNOR => xnor(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::PACK => pack(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::PACKH => packh(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::BREV8 => brev8(rs1),
    Instruction::REV8 => rev8(rs1),
    Instruction::ZIP => zip(rs1),
    Instruction::UNZIP => unzip(rs1),
    Instruction::SHA512SUM0R => sha512sum0r(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA256SUM0 => sha256sum0(rs1),
    Instruction::SHA512SIG0L => sha512sig0l(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA256SIG0 => sha256sig0(rs1),
    Instruction::SHA256SUM1 => sha256sum1(rs1),
    Instruction::SHA512SIG1H => sha512sig1h(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA512SIG0H => sha512sig0h(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA512SIG1L => sha512sig1l(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA512SUM1R => SHA512SUM1R(rs1, rs2),
    Instruction::SHA256SIG1 => sha256sig1(rs1)
  }
}

```

Each enum value now has an explicit integer assignment, as per the DSLX specification.

0146:   }
```
This means that the switch statement requires a default case, where an unknown Instruction is passed in. This is considered a user error and must be communicated to the caller somehow. Rewrite the program as such: change the output of the program to be a tuple, where one member is a valid u32 value returned by a known Instruction function call, and the other member is a boolean which is a "valid output" value that is false when the default case statement is reached.  This means you must add a default case statement that returns zero as the value and sets the "valid output" boolean false, all other cases should return the value as normal and the "valid output" value should be true

// The type for output which is a tuple (value: u32, valid: bool)
type Result = (u32, bool);

// Function to execute a given instruction
fn execute(instruction: Instruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> Result {

    Instruction::ANDN => (andn(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::ORN => (orn(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::XNOR => (xnor(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::PACK => (pack(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::PACKH => (packh(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::BREV8 => (brev8(rs1), true),
    Instruction::REV8 => (rev8(rs1), true),
    Instruction::ZIP => (zip(rs1), true),
    Instruction::UNZIP => (unzip(rs1), true),
    Instruction::SHA512SUM0R => (sha512sum0r(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::SHA256SUM0 => (sha256sum0(rs1), true),
    Instruction::SHA512SIG0L => (sha512sig0l(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::SHA256SIG0 => (sha256sig0(rs1), true),

    Instruction::SHA256SIG1 => (sha256sig1(rs1), true),
    _ => (0, false)  // Default case for unknown Instruction
  }
}

```

In this version, each case of the `match` statement produces a tuple `(u32, bool)`. For all the known instructions, the tuple is `(result, true)`, and for the default case, the tuple is `(0, false)`.

## You
I got this error:
```
0147:     _ => (0, false)  // Default case for unknown Instruction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^ TypeInferenceError: Could not infer a type for this number, please annotate a type.
0148:   }
```
I think you need to change that line of the previously written program to specify it is a u32 type

## ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. Let me correct that for you.

You can specify the type for the number like this: `0u32`.

Here's the corrected line:

```dslx
_ => (0u32, false)  // Default case for unknown Instruction

```

Integrate this corrected line into the previous code and it should resolve the type inference error.

## You
that is still not correct, the format should be u32:0

## ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. Let's fix that.

Here's the correction:

```dslx
_ => (u32:0, false)  // Default case for unknown Instruction

```

Let's incorporate that into the previous code for clarity:

```dslx
// Enumerating the instructions
enum Instruction : u32 {
  ROR = 0,
  ROL,
  RORI,
  ANDN,
  ORN,
  XNOR,
  PACK,
  PACKH,
  BREV8,
  REV8,
  ZIP,
  UNZIP,
  SHA512SUM0R,
  SHA256SUM0,
  SHA512SIG0L,
  SHA256SIG0,
  SHA256SUM1,
  SHA512SIG1H,
  SHA512SIG0H,
  SHA512SIG1L,
  SHA512SUM1R,
  SHA256SIG1
}

// Function to execute a given instruction
fn execute(instruction: Instruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> (u32, bool) {
  match instruction {
    Instruction::ROR => (ror(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::ROL => (rol(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::RORI => (rori(rs1, rs2), true),  // Note: this assumes rs2 is shamt. Adjust if not.
    Instruction::ANDN => (andn(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::ORN => (orn(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::XNOR => (xnor(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::PACK => (pack(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::PACKH => (packh(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::BREV8 => (brev8(rs1), true),
    Instruction::REV8 => (rev8(rs1), true),
    Instruction::ZIP => (zip(rs1), true),
    Instruction::UNZIP => (unzip(rs1), true),
    // ... Continue similarly for the rest of the instructions ...
    _ => (u32:0, false)  // Default case for unknown Instruction
  }
}

```

Now the program should work correctly with the expected DSLX syntax.

## You
that was good, now the execute function also needs a boolean "valid" input, which should produce the typical result when high. Otherwise it should produce the default all zeros value. This is so the execute function knows that it is getting a valid input, and therefore should communicate that is is outputting a valid result.
Can you rewrite the function and add this small functionality?

## ChatGPT
Absolutely. I'll modify the `execute` function to include a `valid` input. When the `valid` input is false, the function will immediately output an all-zero result with the "valid output" set to false. Here's the revised function:

```dslx
fn execute(instruction: Instruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32, valid: bool) -> (u32, bool) {
  if !valid {
    return (u32:0, false);  // Early return if the input is not valid
  }

  match instruction {
    Instruction::ROR => (ror(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::ROL => (rol(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::RORI => (rori(rs1, rs2), true),  // Note: this assumes rs2 is shamt. Adjust if not.
    Instruction::ANDN => (andn(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::ORN => (orn(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::XNOR => (xnor(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::PACK => (pack(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::PACKH => (packh(rs1, rs2), true),
    Instruction::BREV8 => (brev8(rs1), true),
    Instruction::REV8 => (rev8(rs1), true),
    Instruction::ZIP => (zip(rs1), true),
    Instruction::UNZIP => (unzip(rs1), true),
    // ... Continue similarly for the rest of the instructions ...
    _ => (u32:0, false)  // Default case for unknown Instruction
  }
}

```

This should meet the described requirements. The function checks the `valid` input first and returns the default value immediately if it's not set to true. Otherwise, it processes the instruction as before.

## You
I got this error 
```
0259: fn execute(instruction: Instruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32, valid: bool) -> (u32, bool) {
0260:   if !valid {
0261:     return (u32:0, false);  // Early return if the input is not valid
~~~~~~~~~~^----^ ParseError: Cannot find a definition for name: "return"
0262:   }
0263:   match instruction {
```

This language does not use the return keyword, therefore you can remove it. You should also make this an if-else statement, and you should also add the following cases:
```

## ChatGPT
Understood, I'll refactor the `execute` function without the `return` keyword, using an if-else structure. I'll also integrate any additional cases you'd like to add. Here's the revised function:

```dslx
fn execute(instruction: Instruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32, valid: bool) -> (u32, bool) {
  if !valid {
    (u32:0, false)  // Early result if the input is not valid
  } else {
    match instruction {
      Instruction::ROR => (ror(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::ROL => (rol(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::RORI => (rori(rs1, rs2), true),  // Note: this assumes rs2 is shamt. Adjust if not.
      Instruction::ANDN => (andn(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::ORN => (orn(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::XNOR => (xnor(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::PACK => (pack(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::PACKH => (packh(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::BREV8 => (brev8(rs1), true),
      Instruction::REV8 => (rev8(rs1), true),
      Instruction::ZIP => (zip(rs1), true),
      Instruction::UNZIP => (unzip(rs1), true),
      // ... Add any additional cases you want here ...
      _ => (u32:0, false)  // Default case for unknown Instruction
    }
  }
}

```

Now you can add the additional cases you mentioned in the `... Add any additional cases you want here ...` section, or provide them and I can integrate them for you.

## You
can you also add these cases
```
Instruction::SHA512SUM0R => (sha512sum0r(rs1, rs2), true),
277     Instruction::SHA256SUM0 => (sha256sum0(rs1), true),
278     Instruction::SHA512SIG0L => (sha512sig0l(rs1, rs2), true),
279     Instruction::SHA256SIG0 => (sha256sig0(rs1), true),
280     Instruction::SHA256SUM1 => (sha256sum1(rs1), true),
281     Instruction::SHA512SIG1H => (sha512sig1h(rs1, rs2), true),
282     Instruction::SHA512SIG0H => (sha512sig0h(rs1, rs2), true),
283     Instruction::SHA512SIG1L => (sha512sig1l(rs1, rs2), true),
284     Instruction::SHA512SUM1R => (SHA512SUM1R(rs1, rs2), true),
285     Instruction::SHA256SIG1 => (sha256sig1(rs1), true),
```

## ChatGPT
Sure thing. I'll incorporate those cases into the `execute` function:

```dslx
fn execute(instruction: Instruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32, valid: bool) -> (u32, bool) {
  if !valid {
    (u32:0, false)  // Early result if the input is not valid
  } else {
    match instruction {
      Instruction::ROR => (ror(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::ROL => (rol(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::RORI => (rori(rs1, rs2), true),  // Note: this assumes rs2 is shamt. Adjust if not.
      Instruction::ANDN => (andn(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::ORN => (orn(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::XNOR => (xnor(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::PACK => (pack(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::PACKH => (packh(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::BREV8 => (brev8(rs1), true),
      Instruction::REV8 => (rev8(rs1), true),
      Instruction::ZIP => (zip(rs1), true),
      Instruction::UNZIP => (unzip(rs1), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SUM0R => (sha512sum0r(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA256SUM0 => (sha256sum0(rs1), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG0L => (sha512sig0l(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA256SIG0 => (sha256sig0(rs1), true),
      Instruction::SHA256SUM1 => (sha256sum1(rs1), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG1H => (sha512sig1h(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG0H => (sha512sig0h(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG1L => (sha512sig1l(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SUM1R => (SHA512SUM1R(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA256SIG1 => (sha256sig1(rs1), true),
      _ => (u32:0, false)  // Default case for unknown Instruction
    }
  }
}

```

This should cover the provided cases for your RISC-V instructions in DSLX.

## You
you wrote this enum for me before:
```
enum Instruction : u32 {
  3   ROR = 0,
  4   ROL = 1,
  5   RORI = 2,
  6   ANDN = 3,
  7   ORN = 4,
  8   XNOR = 5,
  9   PACK = 6,
 10   PACKH = 7,
 11   BREV8 = 8,
 12   REV8 = 9,
 13   ZIP = 10,
 14   UNZIP = 11,
 15   SHA512SUM0R = 12,
 16   SHA256SUM0 = 13,
 17   SHA512SIG0L = 14,
 18   SHA256SIG0 = 15,
 19   SHA256SUM1 = 16,
 20   SHA512SIG1H = 17,
 21   SHA512SIG0H = 18,
 22   SHA512SIG1L = 19,
 23   SHA512SUM1R = 20,
 24   SHA256SIG1 = 21
 25 }
```
could you please add to it AES32DSI and AES32DSMI

## ChatGPT
Certainly! I'll append `AES32DSI` and `AES32DSMI` to the `Instruction` enum with the subsequent values:

```dslx
enum Instruction : u32 {
  ROR = 0,
  ROL = 1,
  RORI = 2,
  ANDN = 3,
  ORN = 4,
  XNOR = 5,
  PACK = 6,
  PACKH = 7,
  BREV8 = 8,
  REV8 = 9,
  ZIP = 10,
  UNZIP = 11,
  SHA512SUM0R = 12,
  SHA256SUM0 = 13,
  SHA512SIG0L = 14,
  SHA256SIG0 = 15,
  SHA256SUM1 = 16,
  SHA512SIG1H = 17,
  SHA512SIG0H = 18,
  SHA512SIG1L = 19,
  SHA512SUM1R = 20,
  SHA256SIG1 = 21,
  AES32DSI = 22,
  AES32DSMI = 23
}

```

Both `AES32DSI` and `AES32DSMI` have been added to the end of the enum with the values `22` and `23` respectively.

## You
could you swap the positions of the members of this tuple, I want the bool to be the most significant bit in the vector
```
type Result = (u32, bool);
```

## ChatGPT
Of course! Here's the updated tuple type with the `bool` being the first (most significant) member:

```dslx
type Result = (bool, u32);

```

Just make sure to adjust any tuple assignments or usages in your code accordingly.

## You
earlier you wrote this function
```
fn execute(instruction: Instruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32, valid: bool) -> (u32, bool) {
  if !valid {
    (u32:0, false)  // Early result if the input is not valid
  } else {
    match instruction {
      Instruction::ROR => (ror(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::ROL => (rol(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::RORI => (rori(rs1, rs2), true),  // Note: this assumes rs2 is shamt. Adjust if not.
      Instruction::ANDN => (andn(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::ORN => (orn(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::XNOR => (xnor(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::PACK => (pack(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::PACKH => (packh(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::BREV8 => (brev8(rs1), true),
      Instruction::REV8 => (rev8(rs1), true),
      Instruction::ZIP => (zip(rs1), true),
      Instruction::UNZIP => (unzip(rs1), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SUM0R => (sha512sum0r(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA256SUM0 => (sha256sum0(rs1), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG0L => (sha512sig0l(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA256SIG0 => (sha256sig0(rs1), true),
      Instruction::SHA256SUM1 => (sha256sum1(rs1), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG1H => (sha512sig1h(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG0H => (sha512sig0h(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG1L => (sha512sig1l(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA512SUM1R => (SHA512SUM1R(rs1, rs2), true),
      Instruction::SHA256SIG1 => (sha256sig1(rs1), true),
      _ => (u32:0, false)  // Default case for unknown Instruction
    }
  }
}
```
 could you please update it with the new organization for the Result type you just corrected, as well as adding cases for the two new enums I gave you, here are their function signatures. 
```
fn aes32dsi(bs: u8, rs2: u32, rs1: u32) -> u32 {
fn aes32dsmi(bs: u8, rs2: u32, rs1: u32) -> u32 {
```
you may want to add a new input parameter to this function to represent the "bs" variable introduced by the two new cases

## ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's the updated function:

```dslx
fn execute(instruction: Instruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32, bs: u8, valid: bool) -> Result {
  if !valid {
    (false, u32:0)  // Early result if the input is not valid
  } else {
    match instruction {
      Instruction::ROR => (true, ror(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::ROL => (true, rol(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::RORI => (true, rori(rs1, rs2)),  // Note: this assumes rs2 is shamt. Adjust if not.
      Instruction::ANDN => (true, andn(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::ORN => (true, orn(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::XNOR => (true, xnor(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::PACK => (true, pack(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::PACKH => (true, packh(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::BREV8 => (true, brev8(rs1)),
      Instruction::REV8 => (true, rev8(rs1)),
      Instruction::ZIP => (true, zip(rs1)),
      Instruction::UNZIP => (true, unzip(rs1)),
      Instruction::SHA512SUM0R => (true, sha512sum0r(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::SHA256SUM0 => (true, sha256sum0(rs1)),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG0L => (true, sha512sig0l(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::SHA256SIG0 => (true, sha256sig0(rs1)),
      Instruction::SHA256SUM1 => (true, sha256sum1(rs1)),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG1H => (true, sha512sig1h(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG0H => (true, sha512sig0h(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::SHA512SIG1L => (true, sha512sig1l(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::SHA512SUM1R => (true, SHA512SUM1R(rs1, rs2)),
      Instruction::SHA256SIG1 => (true, sha256sig1(rs1)),
      Instruction::AES32DSI => (true, aes32dsi(bs, rs2, rs1)),
      Instruction::AES32DSMI => (true, aes32dsmi(bs, rs2, rs1)),
      _ => (false, u32:0)  // Default case for unknown Instruction
    }
  }
}

```

I've added the `bs` parameter as the fourth parameter in the `execute` function and included the new instructions in the match block. Make sure the order of `rs1` and `rs2` in the new functions is correct based on your needs.
