# DSLX Decode

## You
Introduction to DSLX
Welcome to the world of `DSLX`, a modern hardware description language tailored for precision and ease of use. In this tutorial, we'll cover the basics of the language, key features, and best practices to ensure you can effectively describe digital circuits without the usual pitfalls.

1. Understanding Basic Data Types
In DSLX, the fundamental building block is the bit. Bit types define the width:

`u1` represents a single bit.
`u3` represents 3 bits.
... and so forth.

Remember:
`u8` is used as a character in DSLX. Example: `let null:u8 = '\0';`
Bit types can have attributes. For instance, `u3::MAX` is the maximum value a `u3` can hold, which is `0b111`.

2. Compound Data Types

Tuples and Arrays are your friends:
Tuples are ordered sets. Example: `(u3:0b100, u4:0b1101)`.
Arrays use the bracket notation: `let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3]`;
Tip: Use tuples when you have heterogeneous data, and arrays when your data is uniform.

3. Functions in DSLX

Here's the basic anatomy of a function:
```
fn function_name(input1: type1, input2: type2) -> return_type {
    // Function body
}
```
Important notes:
The return type of a function should always match the actual returned value's type.
Functions support implicit return; the last statement is considered the return value if not explicitly stated.

4. Operations and Pitfalls

Operations are intuitive but require care:
Use standard bitwise operations (`^`, `&`, `|`).
When mixing bit widths, make sure to explicitly handle type promotions.

Explicit Type Extension:
Instead of directly operating on different bit widths, always ensure the operands have the same bit width.
Use concatenation `++` to extend bits. Example: To extend `u1` to `u2`: `let extended_bit: u2 = u1:0 ++ your_bit;`

Avoid Using Reserved Keywords:
In DSLX, certain terms are reserved. One such term we came across is `carry`.
Using reserved keywords as variable or function names will lead to errors.

5. Structs, Enums, and Testing

Structs and Enums allow you to bundle related data:
Structs are custom data types with fields.
Enums allow you to define a type that has a fixed set of constants.
Note: Always remember to test! Use `assert_eq` for testing. It helps validate your logic.

6. Common Mistakes & Tips

Type mismatches:
Always ensure the annotated type matches the inferred type. For example, ensure the function's return type matches the returned value's type.

Casting:
In DSLX, casting is a bit restrictive. Always ensure you're using casting correctly, especially when working with constants.

Reserved Keywords:
Watch out for reserved keywords! Don't use them as variable or function names to avoid confusion.

Conclusion
DSLX offers a blend of modern programming conventions with the precision required for hardware description. By being mindful of the language's nuances and understanding its constructs, you can create efficient and error-free digital circuit descriptions.

## You
I have a new HDL programming language called DSLX that resembles a modern language like **rust** but it has the following key differences:

* Support multiple bit sizes `fn call(a:bits[3])` is the same as `fn call(a:u3)`

* Bit types can have attributes like `u3::MAX == 0b111`

* u8 is a character `let null:u8 = '\0';`

* The tuple type is an ordered set `let pair = (u3:0b100, u4:0b1101);`

* The array type uses bracket notation. E.g: `let my_array: u32[2] = [0,3];`

* assert_eq does not need the ! for macro

* type casting allows to convert across bitwidths. E.g: `assert((u4:0b1100) as u2 == u2:0)`

* Structs and tuples have by default a `PartialEq` implementation.

*DSLX only supports “implicit return”. This means that the final expression in a function will automatically be used as the return value if no explicit return statement is given.

*DSLX only supports assert_eq for testing

*In DSLX the Return type of function body has to match the annotated return type.

*`carry` is a keyword, form naming, use specific naming to avoid confusion with keywords. It's important to choose variable names that are descriptive and meaningful, avoiding those that coincide with reserved keywords


Some sample code:

```
#[test]
fn test_tuple_access() {
  let t = (u32:2, u8:3);
  assert_eq(u8:3, t.1)
}
```

```
#[test]
fn test_black_hole() {
  let t = (u32:2, u8:3, true);
  let (_, _, v) = t;
  assert_eq(v, true)
}
```

```
struct Point {
  x: u32,
  y: u32,
}

#[test]
fn test_struct_equality() {
  let p0 = Point { x: u32:42, y: u32:64 };
  let p1 = Point { y: u32:64, x: u32:42 };
  assert_eq(p0, p1)
}
```

```
_Ok123_321        // valid identifier
_                 // valid identifier

2ab               // not valid identifier
&ade              // not valid identifier
```

```
fn ret3() -> u32 {
   u32:3   // This function always returns 3.
}

fn add1(x: u32) -> u32 {
   x + u32:1  // Returns x + 1, but you knew that!
}
```

```
// a simple parameter x of type u32
   x: u32

// t is a tuple with 2 elements.
//   the 1st element is of type u32
//   the 2nd element is a tuple with 3 elements
//       the 1st element is of type u8
//       the 2nd element is another tuple with 1 element of type u16
//       the 3rd element is of type u8
   t: (u32, (u8, (u16,), u8))
```

```
//Parametric Functions
fn double(n: u32) -> u32 {
  n * u32:2
}

fn self_append<A: u32, B: u32 = {double(A)}>(x: bits[A]) -> bits[B] {
  x++x
}

fn main() -> bits[10] {
  self_append(u5:1)
}
```

```
enum Opcode : u3 {
  FIRE_THE_MISSILES = 0,
  BE_TIRED = 1,
  TAKE_A_NAP = 2,
}

fn get_my_favorite_opcode() -> Opcode {
  Opcode::FIRE_THE_MISSILES
}
```

```
// The unit type, carries no information.
let unit = ();

// A tuple containing two bits-typed elements.
let pair = (u3:0b100, u4:0b1101);
```

```#[test]
fn test_tuple_access() {
  let t = (u32:2, u8:3);
  assert_eq(u8:3, t.1)
}
```

## ChatGPT
Thanks for sharing the details of your new HDL programming language, DSLX. It has clear inspiration from modern languages like Rust while introducing some novel and crucial features specifically tailored for HDL. Here's a breakdown of what we've learned, with some commentary:

Key Features and Differences:

1. Bit Size: DSLX supports various bit sizes, allowing users to specify and type-check at a finer granularity, which can be crucial for optimizing hardware designs.
2. Attributes for Bit Types: Attributes on types, like u3::MAX, make code more readable by providing a semantic way to access meta-information about types.
3. Characters as u8: In DSLX, a u8 represents a character. This is different from many other languages but is a logical choice given the context.
4. Tuples: DSLX uses tuples as ordered sets. This can be useful in packing multiple values of possibly different types.
5. Array Notation: The use of bracket notation for arrays is common in many languages, and its use here aids in clarity.
6. Implicit Return & Testing: Functions automatically return the final expression unless there's an explicit return, simplifying the code. For testing, DSLX only supports assert_eq, which is a basic yet powerful assertion for equality checks.
7. Type Casting & PartialEq: The ability to perform casting across bit widths is a useful feature. Also, default implementations of PartialEq for structs and tuples can save developers significant boilerplate.
8. Reserved Keywords: carry being a keyword emphasizes the importance of choosing descriptive variable names that don't overlap with reserved terms.

Sample Code Analysis:

- The testing annotations (#[test]) and the assert_eq function resemble Rust, which will make it familiar to Rust developers transitioning to DSLX.
- Your provided sample code has made excellent use of tuples, structs, parametric functions, enums, and other features of DSLX, showing the versatility and expressive power of the language.
- The naming convention for identifiers (_Ok123_321 is valid, but 2ab is not) seems to emphasize starting with an underscore or letter, ensuring a more readable codebase.
- The examples of functions like ret3 and add1 show the simplicity and elegance of the implicit return.
- The parametric function self_append is an interesting showcase of the language's capability to express more complex type relationships.

Conclusion:

DSLX, with its blend of modern language features and specific capabilities tailored for hardware description, seems like a powerful tool for HDL developers. The provision of various bit sizes, the emphasis on type safety with explicit type annotations, and the other features described, make it evident that DSLX has the potential to simplify and optimize the hardware design process. The sample code snippets are illustrative and provide a good introduction to the language's capabilities.

Here is a `tiny_adder` function in DSLX which gets 2 one-bit inputs and returns the add result, widened to reflect the carry bit. and also a test for it:  ```

// Returns the add result, widened to reflect the carry bit.
fn tiny_adder(x: u1, y: u1) -> u2 {
  let lhs = x as u2;
  let rhs = y as u2;
  lhs + rhs
}

#[test]
fn test_exhaustive() {
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:0, u1:0), u2:0b00);
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:0, u1:1), u2:0b01);
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:1, u1:1), u2:0b10);
  assert_eq(tiny_adder(u1:1, u1:0), u2:0b01);
}```

## ChatGPT
The `tiny_adder` function you've presented is a concise representation of an adder for single-bit numbers in the DSLX language. This function will add two single-bit inputs and outputs the result in a two-bit number, with the potential carry bit represented as the most significant bit.

Let's break it down:

1. Function Definition:

```rust
fn tiny_adder(x: u1, y: u1) -> u2

```

This function accepts two arguments `x` and `y`, each of a single bit (`u1`) and returns a result that's two bits wide (`u2`).

1. Type Casting:

```rust
let lhs = x as u2;
let rhs = y as u2;

```

The inputs `x` and `y` are cast to two-bit numbers. This ensures that when the addition operation occurs, the resultant sum will fit within the bit-width and will correctly represent any carry.

1. Addition:

```rust
lhs + rhs

```

The two numbers are added. In DSLX, the arithmetic operation will naturally account for any carry, which is why the resultant bit width was widened to two bits.

1. Testing:
You have provided an exhaustive test, test_exhaustive, for the tiny_adder function. This test checks all possible combinations of one-bit numbers:0 + 0 = 000 + 1 = 011 + 0 = 011 + 1 = 10 (where there's a carry)
2. 0 + 0 = 00
3. 0 + 1 = 01
4. 1 + 0 = 01
5. 1 + 1 = 10 (where there's a carry)

These assertions confirm that the function works correctly for all potential inputs.

Overall:
The `tiny_adder` function correctly realizes a 1-bit full adder. The exhaustive test case ensures its functionality across all possible inputs. It's a simple yet fundamental building block in digital logic and hardware design.

Binary Expressions:
DSLX supports a familiar set of binary expressions:

shift-right (`>>`)
shift-left (`<<`)
bit-wise or (`|`)
bit-wise and (`&`)
add (`+`)
subtract (`-`)
xor (`^`)
multiply (`*`)
logical or (`||`)
logical and (`&&`)

## ChatGPT
Binary expressions are fundamental in any programming language, but they hold particular significance in a Hardware Description Language (HDL) like DSLX. This is because operations like bit-wise operations, shifts, and logical operations are intrinsic to digital logic design and manipulation. Let's delve into each of these binary expressions in the context of DSLX:

1. Shift-Right (>>):
Shifts the bits of the left operand to the right by the number specified by the right operand. Any bits shifted off the end are discarded.
Example:

```rust
let result = u4:0b1100 >> u1:1; // result will be u4:0b0110

```

1. Shift-Left (<<):
Shifts the bits of the left operand to the left by the number specified by the right operand. The empty positions are filled with zeros.
Example:

```rust
let result = u4:0b0011 << u1:1; // result will be u4:0b0110

```

1. Bit-wise OR (|):
Performs a bit-wise OR operation between corresponding bits of the operands.
Example:

```rust
let result = u3:0b101 | u3:0b011; // result will be u3:0b111

```

1. Bit-wise AND (&):
Performs a bit-wise AND operation between corresponding bits of the operands.
Example:

```rust
let result = u3:0b101 & u3:0b011; // result will be u3:0b001

```

1. Add (+):
Performs arithmetic addition.
Example:

```rust
let result = u3:0b010 + u3:0b001; // result will be u3:0b011

```

1. Subtract (-):
Performs arithmetic subtraction.
Example:

```rust
let result = u3:0b100 - u3:0b010; // result will be u3:0b010

```

1. XOR (^):
Performs a bit-wise exclusive OR operation.
Example:

```rust
let result = u3:0b110 ^ u3:0b101; // result will be u3:0b011

```

1. Multiply (*):
Performs arithmetic multiplication.
Example:

```rust
let result = u3:0b010 * u3:0b011; // result will be u4:0b0110

```

1. Logical OR (||):
Evaluates to true if either of the operands is true.
Example:

```rust
let result = (u1:1 || u1:0); // result will be true

```

1. Logical AND (&&):
Evaluates to true only if both operands are true.
Example:

```rust
let result = (u1:1 && u1:0); // result will be false

```

These binary expressions in DSLX allow users to manipulate bits, which is crucial for accurate and efficient hardware description. The availability of both bitwise and logical operations provides the flexibility to operate both at the bit-level and boolean logic level.

now, can you add a function `process_instruction` with a case/switch statement with each of them as a case? The contents of each case should be a call to a function of the same name as the instruction.

## ChatGPT
Certainly! In DSLX, a case/switch statement can be implemented using the `match` keyword. Here's how you can write the `process_instruction` function that takes an instruction and two register values `rs1` and `rs2` and processes them based on the instruction type:

```rust
fn process_instruction(instruction: RiscVInstruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
    let result: u32 = match instruction {
        RiscVInstruction::ROR => ror(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::ROL => rol(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::RORI => rori(rs1, rs2),  // Note: This might require a change, since rori function also requires a separate shamt value.
        RiscVInstruction::ANDN => andn(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::ORN => orn(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::XNOR => xnor(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::PACK => pack(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::PACKH => packh(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::BREV8 => brev8(rs1),     // Assumes brev8 only uses rs1
        RiscVInstruction::REV8 => rev8(rs1),       // Assumes rev8 only uses rs1
        RiscVInstruction::zip => zip(rs1),         // Assumes zip only uses rs1
        RiscVInstruction::unzip => unzip(rs1)      // Assumes unzip only uses rs1
    };
    result
}

```

A couple of things to note:

1. The function signatures for some of the operations like rori, brev8, rev8, zip, and unzip are written such that they might not require both rs1 and rs2. In such cases, only the required register (rs1 in the example) is passed.
2. The function rori expects a shift amount (shamt) which might differ from rs2. You might need to adjust the function or the parameters you pass based on the specifics of your use case.
3. As DSLX evolves, some syntax might change. Always refer to the latest DSLX documentation to ensure correct syntax and semantics.

## You
can you write complete code? I mean the code that I sent you and the function you provided

## ChatGPT
Of course! Here's the complete code with the function you provided previously and the new `process_instruction` function:

    let xlen_half: u32 = u32:16;
    let result: u32 = for (i, acc) : (u32, u32) in range(u32:0, xlen_half) {
        let lower_bit: u32 = (rs1 >> i) & u32:1;
        let upper_bit: u32 = (rs1 >> (i + xlen_half)) & u32:1;

        acc | combined_bits
    }(u32:0);  // initialize acc as 0 at the start
    result
}

fn unzip(rs1: u32) -> u32 {
    // Assuming we're working with 32-bit registers, so half-length is 16.
    let xlen_half:

```

## You
can you continue?

## ChatGPT
Certainly! Continuing from where I left off:

```rust
fn unzip(rs1: u32) -> u32 {
    // Assuming we're working with 32-bit registers, so half-length is 16.
    let xlen_half: u32 = u32:16;
    let mut result: u32 = 0;

    for i in 0..xlen_half {
        let lower_bit: u32 = (rs1 >> (2 * i)) & u32:1;
        let upper_bit: u32 = (rs1 >> (2 * i + 1)) & u32:1;
        result |= lower_bit << i;
        result |= upper_bit << (i + xlen_half);
    }

    result
}

fn process_instruction(instruction: RiscVInstruction, rs1: u32, rs2: u32) -> u32 {
    match instruction {
        RiscVInstruction::ROR => ror(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::ROL => rol(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::RORI => rori(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::ANDN => andn(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::ORN => orn(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::XNOR => xnor(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::PACK => pack(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::PACKH => packh(rs1, rs2),
        RiscVInstruction::BREV8 => brev8(rs1),
        RiscVInstruction::REV8 => rev8(rs1),
        RiscVInstruction::zip => zip(rs1),
        RiscVInstruction::unzip => unzip(rs1),
    }
}

fn main() {
    let instruction = RiscVInstruction::ROR;
    let rs1 = 0x12345678;
    let rs2 = 4;

    let result = process_instruction(instruction, rs1, rs2);
    println!("Result of instruction: {:08x}", result);
}

```

Please note:

- I fixed the typo in the enum declaration for RiscVInstruction by adding the correct base enum type (u32).
- I modified the RORI instruction in the process_instruction function to take in rs2 as the immediate value for shifting. If the behavior should be different, you might want to adjust it.
- I wrapped the whole code inside a main function for testing. You can remove or modify this as necessary.

## You
the error: 0098:     let mut result: u32 = 0;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^----^ ParseError: Expected '=', got 'identifier'

## ChatGPT
My apologies for the oversight. DSLX has a syntax that's quite distinct from Rust, and I seem to have momentarily conflated the two.

Let's correct that. The initialization in DSLX doesn't require `let mut`. Instead, you'd declare and define a variable in a single step:

```dslx
result: u32 = u32:0;

```

Here's the corrected portion of the `unzip` function:

```dslx
fn unzip(rs1: u32) -> u32 {
    // Assuming we're working with 32-bit registers, so half-length is 16.
    const XLEN_HALF: u32 = u32:16;
    result: u32 = u32:0;

    for i: u32 in u32:0..XLEN_HALF {
        let lower_bit: u32 = (rs1 >> (2 * i)) & u32:1;
        let upper_bit: u32 = (rs1 >> (2 * i + u32:1)) & u32:1;
        result |= lower_bit << i;
        result |= upper_bit << (i + XLEN_HALF);
    }

    result
}

```

Again, I'm sorry for the oversight. Let me know if there are other corrections or additions you'd like to make!

## ChatGPT
I see. The error indicates that the DSLX language currently requires a catch-all (or default) case in a match expression. This makes sense for safety, ensuring all possible values are handled.

You can add a default case using the `_` pattern. I'll add that for you:

```dslx
const XLEN: u32 = u32:32;

    let rd: u32 = for (i, acc) : (u32, u32) in range(u32:0, xlen_half) {
        let even_bit: u32 = (rs1 >> (i * u32:2)) & u32:1;
        let odd_bit: u32 = (rs1 >> (i * u32:2 + u32:1)) & u32:1;

The default case (`_ => u32:0`) returns a zero for any unhandled enum variant. Adjust as necessary if a different behavior is desired.

## You
now, can you write a test code for this function, `process_instruction`

## ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's a simple test suite for the `process_instruction` function. We'll assume a minimal set of test cases for each of the RISC-V instructions in the enum. These tests will just verify basic functionality; you might want to expand them later for more comprehensive coverage.

```dslx

    let rs1_test: u32 = u32:5;
    let rs2_test: u32 = u32:3;
    let imm_test: u32 = u32:2;

    // Test ROR
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ROR, rs1_test, rs2_test, imm_test), ror(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    // Test ROL
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ROL, rs1_test, rs2_test, imm_test), rol(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    // Test RORI

    // Test XNOR
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::XNOR, rs1_test, rs2_test, imm_test), xnor(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    // Test PACK
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::PACK, rs1_test, rs2_test, imm_test), pack(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    // Test PACKH

    // Test zip
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::zip, rs1_test, rs2_test, imm_test), zip(rs1_test));
    // Test unzip
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::unzip, rs1_test, rs2_test, imm_test), unzip(rs1_test));
}

fn main() {
    test_process_instruction();
}

```

This test suite will call the `process_instruction` function for each instruction type, passing in some test data, and then assert that the result matches the direct call to the corresponding function. If any assertion fails, it indicates a discrepancy between the direct function call and the dispatched call through `process_instruction`.

It seems you didn't provide the error message. Could you please share the specific error you encountered while running the test code? That way, I can help you debug and fix it.

## You
// Test ROR

0132:     assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ROR, rs1_test, rs2_test, imm_test), ror(rs1_test, rs2_test));

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^---------------------------------------------------^ ArgCountMismatchError: Expected 3 parameter(s) but got 4 arguments.


## ChatGPT
The error message indicates that you are providing more arguments than what `process_instruction` function expects.

The function `process_instruction` is defined to take only three arguments: `instruction`, `rs1`, and `rs2`. However, in the test, you're passing four arguments.

You can correct the test by removing the unnecessary `imm_test` argument:

```dslx
#[test]
fn test_process_instruction() {
    let rs1_test: u32 = u32:0b00100000000000000000000000000000;
    let rs2_test: u32 = u32:1;
    
    // Test ROR
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ROR, rs1_test, rs2_test), ror(rs1_test, rs2_test));

    // ... add more tests for other instructions here ...
}

```

Remember, this fix will work for instructions that don't use the immediate value. If you decide to expand `process_instruction` to also handle instructions with immediates in the future, you would need to adjust this test accordingly.

## You
the error: 0134:     // Test ROL

0135:     assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ROL, rs1_test, rs2_test, imm_test), rol(rs1_test, rs2_test));

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^------^ ParseError: Cannot find a definition for name: "imm_test"
can you fix it for all tests?

## ChatGPT
Certainly! The error message indicates that `imm_test` is not defined, and as previously discussed, the `process_instruction` function doesn't accept a fourth argument.

You need to remove the `imm_test` argument from all the calls in the test. Here's the corrected test code:

```dslx
#[test]
fn test_process_instruction() {
    let rs1_test: u32 = u32:0b00100000000000000000000000000000;
    let rs2_test: u32 = u32:1;
    
    // Test ROR
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ROR, rs1_test, rs2_test), ror(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    
    // Test ROL
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ROL, rs1_test, rs2_test), rol(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    
    // ... add more tests for other instructions here ...
}

```

Simply repeat the pattern shown above for each test case. You can replace the instruction type (e.g., `RiscVInstruction::ROL`) and the corresponding function (e.g., `rol()`) to test the other instructions. Make sure you don't include `imm_test` in any of these calls.

## You
can you write all tests?

## ChatGPT
Of course. Let's continue the test cases for each instruction, keeping in mind the functionality you've defined:

```dslx
#[test]
fn test_process_instruction() {
    let rs1_test: u32 = u32:0b00100000000000000000000000000000;
    let rs2_test: u32 = u32:1;
    
    // Test ROR
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ROR, rs1_test, rs2_test), ror(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    
    // Test ROL
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ROL, rs1_test, rs2_test), rol(rs1_test, rs2_test));

    // Test RORI
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::RORI, rs1_test, rs2_test), rori(rs1_test, rs2_test));

    // Test ANDN
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ANDN, rs1_test, rs2_test), andn(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    
    // Test ORN
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::ORN, rs1_test, rs2_test), orn(rs1_test, rs2_test));

    // Test XNOR
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::XNOR, rs1_test, rs2_test), xnor(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    
    // Test PACK
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::PACK, rs1_test, rs2_test), pack(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    
    // Test PACKH
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::PACKH, rs1_test, rs2_test), packh(rs1_test, rs2_test));
    
    // Test BREV8
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::BREV8, rs1_test, rs2_test), brev8(rs1_test));
    
    // Test REV8
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::REV8, rs1_test, rs2_test), rev8(rs1_test));
    
    // Test zip
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::zip, rs1_test, rs2_test), zip(rs1_test));
    
    // Test unzip
    assert_eq(process_instruction(RiscVInstruction::unzip, rs1_test, rs2_test), unzip(rs1_test));
}

```

This test covers all the instructions. Note that for unary operations (which only use `rs1`), the `rs2_test` is redundant but shouldn't cause any errors in this context.

## ChatGPT
The error you're seeing is because test functions in most languages, including Rust, aren't typically meant to be explicitly called from the `main` function or other parts of the program. They're designed to be run separately by a test runner. In the case of Rust, the test runner is built into the `cargo` command-line tool.

Here's how you'd usually run tests in Rust:

```bash
cargo test

```

This command automatically discovers and runs all test functions in your crate.

If you still want to call the test function from `main` for some reason (e.g., for debugging), you can make a normal function and call it from both the test and the `main` function. But this is not idiomatic Rust.

However, if you want to proceed that way:

```rust
fn main() {
    run_process_instruction_tests();
}

fn run_process_instruction_tests() {
    // the contents of test_process_instruction()
}

#[test]
fn test_process_instruction() {
    run_process_instruction_tests();
}

```

Again, I'd recommend just using `cargo test` and not trying to call the test function from `main`.
